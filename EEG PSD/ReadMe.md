Anova analysis, bar plotting and line plotting.

Anova is used for a statistical comparison of Power sepctral density for EEG data of actual and pretending.
The script iterates through each frequency band across frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma), performs ANOVA, and assesses whether differences in PSD are statistically significant based on a predefined alpha level (0.05).

Bar plot is used for visualization of the PSD across the EEG frequency bands, providing a statistical calculation and generats the plots based on each frequency. 
Providing an insight of graphical comparison between Actual data PSD and Pretending data of Each band.

Line plot is to creat a plot compering the Differnce of Each EEG data, where it enhances visual understanding of differences between actual and pretending data.
