These steps are done in the Matlab, installed softwares, EEGLab and Brainstorm from the Matlab website.

The brainstorm was used to read the rawfiles with subject IDS, imports the EEG data, averages the epochs and gives an overview report or further ananlysis.
The EEGLab is used for analysis, including data import, channel/feature removal for unwanted data, re-referencing, filtering of data and applying the Indenpendent component analysis(ICA) for the artifacts removal.
