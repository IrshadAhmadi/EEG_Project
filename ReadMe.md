Step 1: Collecting EEG Data
Step 2: Preprocessing EEG data
Step 3: Feature Extraction
Step 4: Machine learning model, Training, validition and Test.
Step 5: Comparing Result in step 3 and 4.


The research is designed to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of EEG data from the prefrontal cortex, associated with the cognitive tasks, EEG data steps involved are  preprocessing, feature extraction, statistical analysis and machine learning classification.
Where it contains data-preparation, feature extraction, visualization of data and model evaluation, providing an insight about EEG patterns and machine learning model performance for detecting the specific condition.
